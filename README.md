# My Neovim Setup

Welcome to my Neovim setup repository! Here, you'll find the configuration and plugins that I use to make Neovim a powerful and versatile code editor. Feel free to explore, use, and customize this setup to suit your own needs.

## Installation

1. Install Neovim on your system (minimum version X.X.X required).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neovim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
```
Install the necessary plugins by opening Neovim and running:
```vim
:PlugInstall
```
This will install all the plugins specified in the init.vim configuration file.
